    <h1>Sundial</h1>

    From Wikipedia, the <em>free</em> encyclopedia.
    <p>
      <strong>A sundial measures time by the position of the sun</strong>. The
      most commonly seen designs, such as the <em>'ordinary' </em>or standard
      garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat <strong>surface</strong> marked
      with the hours of the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time
      indicated by the shadow changes. However, sundials can be designed for any
      surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow. Most sundial
      designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure
      standard and <strong>daylight saving time</strong>, as well.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are
      <strong>from ancient Egypt</strong>, and were developed further by other
      cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman cultures. A type of
      sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah
      38:2). The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160
      BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have invented a
      <strong>universal sundial </strong>that could be used
      <em>anywhere on Earth</em>. The French astronomer Oronce Fine constructed
      a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani
      published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included
      instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and
      horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad
      horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with
      accompanying illustrations.

    <h2>Installation of standard sundials</h2>
    <p>
      Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By
      tilting such a sundial, it may be installed so that it will
      <em>keep time</em>. However, some mass-produced garden sundials are
      inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected. A sundial
      designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by
      tilting its base so that its style or gnomon is<strong> parallel</strong>
      to the Earth's axis of <em>rotation</em>, so that it points at the north
      celestial pole in the northern hemisphere, or the south celestial pole in
      the southern hemisphere. A local standard time zone is nominally 15
      degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic and political<em>
        boundaries</em
      >. A sundial can be rotated around its style or gnomon (which must remain
      pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most
      cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west
      suffices. To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of
      numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals
      in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter.
      <em>Rotating </em>the sundial will not work well because most sundials do
      not have equal hour angles. Ordinary sundials do not correct apparent
      solar time to clock time. There is a 15 minute variation through the year,
      known as the equation of time, because the Earth's orbit is slightly
      elliptical and its axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit. A
      quality sundial will include a
      <strong>permanently-mounted table</strong> or
      <strong>graph</strong> giving this correction for at least each month of
      the year. Some more-complex sundials have curved hour-lines, curved
      gnomons or other arrangements to directly display the clock time.
